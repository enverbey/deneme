# Java Introduction

Welcome to the Java Basics repository! In this section, we will cover the fundamentals of Java, including setting up your environment and writing your first Java program.

## Why Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for building robust and scalable applications. It is platform-independent, which means Java code can run on any machine that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Setting up Java
1. **Install JDK (Java Development Kit)**: You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK. Make sure to set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable correctly.
2. **Choose an IDE**: We recommend using popular IDEs like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Java extensions.

## Hello World Program

Below is a simple example of a "Hello World" program in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
